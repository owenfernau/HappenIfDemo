  -This is a web application I worked on in the beginning of 2018. Having worked odd jobs and dealt with university bureacracies
  it seems that a lot of decisions come from the top down, many of which are
  meant to minimize risk and liability, but suffer from extreme inflexibility.
  <br><br>
  -Maybe you get the idea, but essentially the world is still pretty inefficient
  and we could work together to democratize our choices.
  <br><br>
  -The problem the app attempts to solve is how choices are made, and how trying
  to make changes from the bottom up is difficult.
  <br><br>
  -There are a lot of questions about how digital governance can work. Who can
  vote on what? What is the time frame of the vote? Is the vote count public
  as the vote happens? After someone votes? Should digital currency be involved?
  As in will adding a micropayment aspect to the voting system add a skin in
  game effect?
